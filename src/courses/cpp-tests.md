# Introduction

In this course you will learn about good unit tests (GUTs) and test-driven development (TDD). 

- What practices support readable and maintainable tests? 
- What test pitfalls hold developers and products back? 
- How do you make testing fun and not a chore? 

We will also discuss similarities, differences and challenges of unit testing across different codebases, with different frameworks and libraries.

# ðŸŽ“ What's under the hood?

#### Module 1/4
- What do we mean by unit test?
- How do unit tests fit into the testing and development landscape?
- Addressing common objections to and weaknesses in unit testing
- What do GUTs look like?
- The elements of TDD
- C++ unit-testing frameworks and features (Google Test, Catch and others)

#### Module 2/4
- How to choose test data based on domain
- Test naming, partitioning and structure
- The anatomy of test cases and test suites
- Variations in TDD and the test-first lifecycle
- Plain old unit testing (POUT), defect-driven testing (DDT) and iterative test-last (ITL)

#### Module 3/4
- Identifying and adjusting overfitting and underfitting tests
- Refactoring tests
- Common test smells
- Reasons writing tests can be hard, and how to respond
- Trade-offs between integration and unit testing


#### Module 4/4
- Dependency management smells and techniques
- Mocks, stubs and other test doubles and C++ support for kinds of polymorphism
- Avoiding mock-overdosing (following Java-style mocking practices in C++)
- When to use values instead of test doubles
- Using lambdas and function objects to reduce use of full test-double objects
- Testing legacy code
