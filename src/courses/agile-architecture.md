      text: It was a practical, thought-provoking workshop. I understood why our "ad-hoc" approach to architecture doesn't usually end up well. Made a gazillion of notes.

      text: Deep, non-trivial course for experienced engineers working in large enterprises. Not for juniors, because the course requires a certain level of maturity.
tldr: In this masterclass you will look at the relationship between Agile processes and good architecture, taking in development process models, architectural styles, requirements techniques, sufficient modeling techniques, design patterns, and testing practices.

      Kevlin is a consultant, speaker, writer and trainer. His development interests are in patterns, programming, practice and process. He has been a columnist for a number of magazines and online publications including: The Register, Better Software, Java Report, CUJ, and C++ Report.

      Kevlin is also the co-author of two volumes in the Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture series: A Pattern Language for Distributed Computing and On Patterns and Pattern Languages. He also contributed to 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know.
    quote: All too often architecture is seen as a separate concern from development process, whereas the two are intertwined â€” what you build is influenced by how you build it, and vice versa. How does architecture and agility get on? That's the point of the workshop. If you'd like to find out more, join this course!

# Introduction

**In this Masterclass you will look together at the relationship between Agile processes and good architecture**, taking in development process models, architectural styles, requirements techniques, sufficient modelling techniques, design patterns and testing practices. This masterclass is for software architects and lead developers looking to broaden and sharpen their skills in the disciplines touched on by software architecture, not just specific technologies. 


# ðŸ’¡ We'll answer the following key questions:
- What do we mean by software architecture?
- What is the relationship between development process and software architecture?
- How do agile and lean thinking relate to software architecture?
- What are some of the properties of a good software architecture?
- How does organisational structure affect software architecture?
- How can software architecture be evolved and grown?
- How can we handle change and uncertainty?
- What role can testing play in software architecture?
- What do we mean by legacy code and technical debt?
- How can we respond to and handle legacy?
