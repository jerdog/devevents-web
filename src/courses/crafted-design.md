      text: Mind-blowing! I liked that it was very fast-paced and there was no time to chill â€“ everyone was engaged in coding, pairing, discussions. Two days is not enough. More please!
tldr: This workshop is for experienced developers who want to get better at designing well-crafted solutions. This training addresses design from the most micro level (via TDD) all the way up to defining microservices by analysing business requirements. After this workshop, youâ€™ll be able to design software that is responsive to changing requirements and new functionalities, avoiding pitfalls that lead to legacy code.

# Introduction

Crafted Design is for experienced developers who want to get better at designing well-crafted solutions. This training addresses design from the most micro level (via TDD) all the way up to defining microservices by analysing business requirements. After this workshop, youâ€™ll be able to design software that is responsive to changing requirements and new functionalities, avoiding pitfalls that lead to legacy code.

# You will learn how to:
- Use two main TDD styles (Classicist and Outside-In) to drive the design of your code
- Drive out a flexible design at different levels, from details of real-world all the way up to microservices
- Build software that is not bound to a specific technology or framework by keeping them at the boundaries of your system
- Express your business domain in every facet of your application, not just methods and classes
- Keep your design clean as your application grows and requirements change
- Let your architecture emerge, rather than designing a rigid and unchangeable structure up-front
- Derive a microservices architecture from business requirements and bounded contexts
- Model behaviour instead of state keeping your design more aligned to business goals

# ðŸŽ“ What's under the hood?

#### Day 1

**Here we learn software design at the code level.** Youâ€™ll be working in pairs on two exercises, using different TDD styles and comparing their solutions. Expect plenty of design discussions around the exercises and real-world scenarios.

- Write tests focused on behaviour instead of state
- Emergent design through classicist TDD
- SOLID principles
- Balanced Abstraction Principle (BAP)
- Use TDD as a design tool with Outside-In TDD
- Tell, Donâ€™t Ask
- Commands, Queries, and Open/Close Principle compliance.

#### Day 2

**We dedicate the second day to software design at the application and microservices level.** You'll learn about internal software structure, layers, components, delivery mechanism, core domain, using business requirements to drive design, how to define the responsibility of each service, how services collaborate, their internal and external visibility, number of services we need to create, etc.

- Principles of Domain-Driven Design
- IDD â€“ Interaction-Driven Design
- Structure projects in a way that expresses what the application does and what it is about
- Differences between layers, hexagons, features, and components
- Modelling behaviour using Outside-In Design
- Identifying services from business rules
- Express design and architecture in code, but keeping your domain clear
- Understanding Impact Mapping and how a services architecture can real-world from it.






<div class="notification is-light is-info">

This course is for developers already proficient with TDD in real-world projects. If you're starting your TDD journey, we recommend taking **[Crafting Code](/courses/crafting-code)** course first.

# Requirements
This course is for software developers that are:
- Ready to write a lot of code. This code is 100% hands-on.
- Experienced with at least one OO language
- Able to apply xUnit, mocking, and TDD in practice

<div class="notification is-light is-warning">
Developers must bring their own laptops with prepared development environment consisting of Git, their favourite Object-Oriented language, a unit test framework, a mocking library, and be able to build and run tests.
