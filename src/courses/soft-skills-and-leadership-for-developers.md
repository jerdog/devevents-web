      text:  The training didn't meet my expectations... and that was awesome! I expected another "let's be agile" kind of training, which would be not that related to real projects I'm working on. Instead we've taken a look at the problems from a completely different perspective (soft skills) and I've received lots of useful information in that regard. Second day with discussions was great as well. At the end I have a pack of enthusiasm and ideas to try to improve things around me (not just work). Thanks for your great job and being such a positive guy!
