# Introduction



**This course is designed to help developers write well-crafted code** ‚Äî code that is clean, testable, maintainable, and expresses the business domain well. This entirely hands-on course will teach you practical coding, refactoring, and testing techniques, that you'll be able to immediately apply to real-world projects.

**Software craftsmanship is at the heart of this course.** Throughout, you will learn about the software craftsmanship attitude to development and how to apply it to your workplace.

# üéì You will learn how to
- Write clean code that is easy to understand and maintain
- Understand and apply design principles that lead to clean code
- Understand SOLID principles and Domain-Driven Design
- Make existing code clean and why it's not as easy as it sounds
- Use tests to design and build your code base
- Write unit tests that express intent, not implementation
- Become more proficient in Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Focus your tests and production code according to business requirements using Outside-In TDD
- Avoid over-engineering and large rewrites by incrementally evolving your design using tests

Once you have an understanding of the principles at work, we will apply them to Legacy Code to help you gain confidence in improving legacy projects through **testing, refactoring and redesigning.**
