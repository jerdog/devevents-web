      text: I wanted to know how I could improve the quality of my code and your course gave me some tools to achieve that. I liked that it was about more than writing code. You gave some tips on how to deal with management and what you can do as a developer to change that for the better and that you need to stay true to yourself. I like that the course doesn't really end's here. That there is homework and that you encourage us to stay in contact. You inspired me to become a better developer and gave me the energy to become the best that I can be.

      text: The course was absolutely above expectations. Usually courses just reuse "Clean code" book and provide some "common sense" recommendations. But not this one! More than 95% of information was top new and mind-blowing. I've got new practical tips to use in my everyday work and a completely new look on the things I do. Moreover, it inspired me for further growth as a professional and gave different directions, how to do it! Thanks, Eduard, this was the best training I ever attended!
tldr: In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to build modern, clean, and maintainable enterprise applications using the latest Java techniques, libraries, and secret gems. The course is for Java developers who want to expand their knowledge beyond trivial and easy-to-google concepts.

# Introduction

Do you want to write code that your teammates will admire? Develop real-world Java applications that are easy to maintain? Move fast without compromising quality?

**Then this course is for you.**

During this intensive and practical 2-day workshop, you will learn how to develop modern, clean, and maintainable applications using the Java best practices. This is not a trivial Java 14 course for beginners. Here you'll learn real-world stuff from class design and unit testing to large-scale architecture, controlling quality, and getting out of technical debt.

âš¡ Warning: After this course, your Java code will never be the same again.

# ðŸ’¡ Highlights

- The course is based on real-world project code, stories and examples.
- The course demos are built using real-world libraries such as Spring, Hibernate, and Guava.
- The course includes practical Lab work and an optional homework assignment.
- The course is updated to support Java 14 additions and functional programming idioms.
